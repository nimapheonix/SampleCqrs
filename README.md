Creating a sample application for Implementing CQRS with .Net 6, PostgreSQL, and Angular.
The backend was fully covered by tests applying Fluent Assertation and XUnit.
All the exceptions are handled through a middleware that provides appropriate messages for clients.
The CQRS pattern is implemented by MediatR, and Command and query validations are implemented by Fluent Validation.
